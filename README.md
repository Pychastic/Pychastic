# Pychastic
A Python library for stochastic data science from a Bayesian perspective, on top of PyMC3.

The aim is for Pychastic to be to PyMC3 what Keras is to Tensorflow and what Lasagne is to Theano -- a higher-level
library for convenience and ease of use, in the context of stochastic data science and Bayesian inference.
